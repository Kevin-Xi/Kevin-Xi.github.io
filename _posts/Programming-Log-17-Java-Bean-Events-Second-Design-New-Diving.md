The MVC code in *Introduction to Java Programming* need the knowledge of creating custom event set, so I turn back to pick up it. The *synchronized* mechinism is really troublesome, and something call me attention: 

	processEvent(new ActionEvent(Object source, int id, String command));

How the last argument use? Is it means Java has some kind of *exec* in python?


Afternoon, I study the example code of *MVCDemo*, and as a reference, design a new architecture of my *SortAlgorithmDemo*.


I started reading chapter 5 of *Diving into Python*, and this time, I really have some concept of the example code.

+ How to deal with the path with space?


Again, I watch the public course of *Stanford Programming*, the professor this time wear a dinner apron, a funny guy. And I know a funny thing that Peter Norvig claims to have created the world's largest palindrome on  2003.11.23, with 17259 words long.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **70 hours**.
