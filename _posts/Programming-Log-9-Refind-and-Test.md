I thought over my design and the concept of *Pair Programming*, and redesign my program. So far, so good. I found when designing a web program, sometime you should think both server and client side at the same time. That is difficult, so I limit every situations of each part and solve it one by one, it also useful:) and considering to be a good practise to my deliberateness.


I try to connect my friend in evening, but it's unsucceed, I wonder if it is a problem of firewall.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **37 hours**.
