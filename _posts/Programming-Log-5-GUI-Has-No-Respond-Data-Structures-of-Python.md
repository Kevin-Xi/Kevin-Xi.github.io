I add an *ActionListener* to allow user input IP address manually. But when the connection established, the GUI of *Client* didn't respond anymore. I try to use *SwingUtilities.invokeLater()*, but it didn't work as I thought.


I want to know why python has those much data structures like *list*, *tuple*, *dict*. I find the *Python Tutorial* may gives me some sample code.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **16 hours**.
