Yesterday my classmate C(what's your name?) came up with some idea and wanted to find a group of people to make it out. He wants to digitized himself and because Sherlock once talk about my "AI knowledge" to him in a exaggerating way, C ask me and Sherlock to get involved in the project. They are both skillful programmer so I feel pleasant to work with them.

Today we have a discussion aimed to decide some specific point to get start. At most time I play as a listener because they are both very intelligence and with a slow-running-brain I should make some effort to catch up.

However, at last we reached 3 ideas and I emailed them to a professer I knew, expecting to get some suggestions from him.
