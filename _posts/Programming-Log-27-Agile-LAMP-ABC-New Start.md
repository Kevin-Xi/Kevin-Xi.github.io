Today I read the book *The Art of Agile Development*. In the evening I searched something about LAMP. I recalled I have seen an artical on *CFAN* about how to create a BBS with an old computer and 1 RMB (2007.9). 

After the discussion of morning, we decide to start a "seek for help" website (I have two ideas that is an online version "course grid" and a "tree hole"). I think this idea will work:) Now I feel fulfill again.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **98 hours**.
