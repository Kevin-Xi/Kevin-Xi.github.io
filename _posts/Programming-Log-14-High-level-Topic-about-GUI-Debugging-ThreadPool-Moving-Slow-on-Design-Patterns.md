Today morning I learned something about *Containers*, *Layout Managers* and *Borders* of Java. I realize Java has some reused code to relief us out of the logic not about what we considered.


I also modified something in *SortAlgorithmDemo*. I try to applied the new *PausableThreadExecutor* class I wrote to manage the thread. Learning by API doc is hard, and *Java Tutorials* has no example code about this, so I need to connect APIs using my imagination. Finally, the class has too many arguments which completely confused me, I gave up for now.


I found it really hard to control the states of thread. Whether it is a design problem, or a instantiation problem, or a language problem, or a hardware problem, I cannot tell.


I readed the chapter 2 of *Design Patterns*, but I comprehend little of it.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **58 hours**.
