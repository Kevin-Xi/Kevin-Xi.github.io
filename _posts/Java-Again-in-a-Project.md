I have been working on a little project (but big for me) these days. I have spent all mornings of the past week. But the progress I made really make me pleasure.


This program is, originally, my final project (with bonus) of our algorithm class. It's a histogram demo of six sort algorithm including *Selection, Insertion, Bubble, Quick, Heap and Shell sort*. (You could find it at my [github](https://github.com/Kevin-Xi/SortAlgorithmDemo "My github page") It's really a simple program that the first version only took one afternoon (the afternoon before deadline:), it's Dec 31st 2012, we would have exams after a three-days New Year Holiday). Few days later, my professor send me an email in reply, he said my job is somehow valuable and courage me to work on it during winter vacation. He also give me some advices on it which is really helped. I took his suggestion.


I will upgrade my progress of this.
