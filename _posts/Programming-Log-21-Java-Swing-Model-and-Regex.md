Today morning I try to install jdk in my *Arch Linux* on *VirtualBox*. I really had a difficult time. *makepkg* command can't run, and the error message encountered a encoding problem. Hard time.

And after breakfast, I continue learning Java. I found the JTable has 7 ctors!!! I begin to understand why python not overload.

I still have difficult to understand which part of a JComponent is controller, is that the methods you write?

At evening, I almost wept. I really want to learn *regex* for a long time, so when I saw it today, I decide to do. I search my *EverNote* and find out 2 articals about *regex*, but the metacharacter is blur. So I search the web and find a guy named "*deerchor*" and his quick-tutor. Bearing the 10-word-long items and wired syntax, I finished it.

I thought *perl* hackers must like this: in many situations there seem to be you have "*more than one way to solve it*". And I surprisely realized that *regex* has no a strong standard, why?

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **81 hours**.
