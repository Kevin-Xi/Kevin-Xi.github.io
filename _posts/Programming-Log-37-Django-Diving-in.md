I spent one and a half hours on processing the database by django. I would say that with python, database processing become more easy. And *The Django Book* is also easy to understand. But went through the example codes while learning new concepts made me a little exhausted.

This afternoon I finished reading chapter 6 of *The Django Book*, which introduce the *admin* module of django.

And in the evening I learned something about *form*. I think I maybe can write the register and login models today, but requires of things are more than that I have imagined.

+ Why a *view* cannot read local file? Security reason?
+ How to configure the *urls.py* when it need to import two different *views* in different *app*?

Answer:

+ It can. But need to write 'sitemenu/somefile' even if there are in the same directory.

To sum up, I spent **5 hours** on programming today, and totally **125 hours**.
