This morning I redesigned my *SortAlgorithmDemo*. I quickly got confused by many problems, so I decide review the example code *MVCDemo.java* of *introduction to Java Programming*. Soon, I realized my former design had misunderstandings of which part is M, V, C of the software. I think it need a fully understand of either *MVC Model* or *Events*, which two parts binding closely.

I continued my work this afternoon, but there are always somewhere hard to get through. i don't know which one is better, that design fully first, or design without detail and doing while designing.

I finished first 3 chapters of *Pratical Common Lisp* this evening. Because I have some conceptions of python and SQL, now I understand deeply of the example of Chapter 3. I saw something about *lambda* and *macro* and have a feel that the reason of different is the first-class position of function.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **92 hours**.
