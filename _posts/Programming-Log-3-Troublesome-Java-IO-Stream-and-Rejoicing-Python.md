The project I started yesterday needs *I/O stream* processing. So many subclass of *I/O Stream* and *I/O Reader and Writer*, it took me a while to make a glimpse of them and picked out what I need. I wonder if they are all useful. 


I simply want to send a string in the *JTextField* from one side to the other, I thought Java should have some ready-made methods of this function, but I was wrong. So I gave up API doc and turn to *Core Java* to find some example code, but it also blur. Finally I search the web, and it came out an absolutely not highlevel way to get whole string of *InputStreamReader* out, which is seems like the trick when I program with C++. Since I am a new hand, I wonder if I again, use a screwdriver as a hammer (that is, the wrong way to use *InputStreamReader*). But Java, called itself as a "highlevel language", appear to be somehow garrulous to me.


I watched chapter 5 and 6 of *A Byte of Python* tonight, and life is happy again:) I found *Learning Python* has over 700 pages! It may cover ALL details of python! I decide to read it as a keep-my-skill-warming book during my space time.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **10 hours**.
