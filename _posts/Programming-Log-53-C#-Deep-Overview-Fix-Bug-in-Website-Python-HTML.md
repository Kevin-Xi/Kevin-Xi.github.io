Yes, C# support many new advance features, but when to use them? I'm confused, specifically while learning python.

Today afternoon's exercise, In *ListView*, how to know if there is an item selected? What difference between

	listView1.SelectedItems==null;

and

	listView1.SelectedItems.Count<1;

The *SubItems* concept is somehow tricky because although I know it acts like resource manager in Windows, but when use *details* mode to show, it more like a list.

Visual programming for GUI is convence, but maybe not flexibility compare to *LayoutManage* in Java.

Tonight I fix another authenization bug of our website and then resume my python course.

I can't run my *BaseHTMLProcessor.py*. Why?

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **161 hours**.
