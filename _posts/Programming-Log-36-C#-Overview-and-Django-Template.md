I decided to have a little review of *data structing* and *algorithm*, so I read the *introduction to Java Programming* again. The first five or six chapters of volume II may help.

I spent some time on reviewing python and reading *C# 3.0 In a Nutshell* during our C# class. It really different from the programming language books I have read, it's more like a cookbook. Since I don't like C# so much, I will try to adapt this kind of style.

In the afternoon, I wrote some templates by django for my test site. The template could inherit, which really surprised me.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **120 hours**.
