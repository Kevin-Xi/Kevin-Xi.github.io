My two Java project have encounter its "bottle neck". 


The *SortAlgorithmDemo* is bad-designed, I'd like to push it away temporarily and during this time, read the *Design Patterns* for answer.


The question I asked yesterday in *RemotePairProgramming*, I dreamed a way last night(:)) to analysis. I depart the problem as 4 situation and analysis them independently. But I found what I want for this project is, maybe not very pragmatic.


This afternoon I read a lot of data, there is an intriguing concept Radius Of Comprehension.


I try to log website use python this afternoon and evening, but nothing luck. But I talk to my friend about my *RemotePairProgramming*, he gave me some advices, I will have a try tomorrow and see if it is what I want.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **33 hours**.
