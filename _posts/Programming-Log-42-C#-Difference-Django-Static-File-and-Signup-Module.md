I found the book *C# 3.0 In a Nutshell* is some kind of offical document, that not step-by-step style. but cover every details when talk about a part(like *Learning Python*). This may not suitable for those programmers who want to quickly make progress.

I realize something new in C#. Like the concept of the argument passing method(*None*,*ref*,*out*), I don't know for now if this feature is . The difference is *the arguments could be passed as both value and reference, but regardless whether itself is value type or referenve type*.

Today afternoon, I read the book and found 3 ways to write a *ctor*, that confuse me. What situations did they use? C#, seems to me, is introduced so many feature and become some kind of hodgepodge.

I also have problem on the use of the *properties*, *index* difference between get field by dot.

Finally I know how to deal with *static files* in django. I still have some problem on that signup module, like *HttpRedirect*. And I want to know is there a standard django framework?

To sum up, I spent **5 hours** on programming today, and totally **138 hours**.
