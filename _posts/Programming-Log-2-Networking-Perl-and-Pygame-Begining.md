I covered some very basic things on Java networking, like socket, server, client. I tried to make a real-time-refreshing text area between server and client, so that can make part of my RemotePairProgramming project. The most confusing things is *I\O stream* and listener of *JTextArea*, why Java just don't have something can listen the change of *JTextArea* and transmit it as string? I should find it out.


Afternoon I have a good time with perl. I found the author of *Learning Perl* really have sense of humor, I list something funny down here: 

+ p36, something about add parentheses when there are lots of operators: *"So be nice to your maintenance programmer: you may be that person one day."*
+ p36, *nearly every sequence of punctuation is used for something in Perl*: *"So, if you get writer's block, just let the cat walk across the keyboard, and debug the result."*

Besides, it is little different about *comparison operators*(numeric, string) with other languages I have known.


I also do some pygame programming tonight, I found a book named *Making Games with Python & Pygame*, author Al Sweigart.


To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **6 hours**.
