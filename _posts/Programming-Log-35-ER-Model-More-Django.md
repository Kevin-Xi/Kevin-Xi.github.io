Today in the class I spend some time on ER model and agile. Since now I could design some ER model, but I still don't know how to change it to a database schema, or say, what is the relationship between this and the *relational model*.

When it's come to the relational model, I can't help recall the knowledge I got when took the *Introduction to Western Philosophy* last year which given by Prof.Lin. They seem all about different ways to represent the world.

In evening I learned *views*, *url settings*, *templates* about Django.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **119 hours**.
