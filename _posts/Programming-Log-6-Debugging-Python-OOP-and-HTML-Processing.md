I didn't know why my GUI of client not responding until I decided to **go through the code line by line**. The bug is so clear in that way beyond my expection, I realized the time I wasting on this small bug is not worthy. When a bug come out, I find myself think so much and do so little. Next time I encounter a bug, just **go through the code line by line** first. I have send the code to my friend and ask him test with me. And the questions remained here:

+ An obvious example of SwingUtilities
+ The listener of *JTextArea*


Some questions of python OOP part:

+ Is there any "static methods" for a class?
+ In inheritance, is there necessary to invoke *SuperClass.__init__(self)* rather than *SuperClass()* ?


The answer of the second question is yes. The *SuperClass* use the second way to init is an irrelvant one.


The questions of HTML processing and urllib2:

+ What is *GET*, *POST*?
+ How to make the packet?
+ more on SGMLParser


To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **22 hours**.
