After some attempt, I rethough if I should, or need use *MVC Model* for this project. I wrote my thoughts on a piece of paper and decided since it had no big problem now, I will resume former design. The design stage is really cause headache.

My enthusiastic of Lisp become bigger and bigger this days. But first few pages of chapter 4 is not easy to understand, why S-expression make *Lisp* stronger?

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **94 hours**.
