Today morning, after a quick view of *JOptionPane*, *JDialog*, *JColorChooser*, *JFileChooser*, I have a glimpse at *MVC*. I saw each part of the program hold its lower reaches part, and has some *synchronise* mechanism. Some how I feel it maybe helpful to my *SortAlgorithmDemo*. I will cover it tomorrow.


I add fundamental editor function to the *RemotePairProgramming*, such as save, open, set foreground and background, clear. 

+ What is *append()* of *JTextPane*?
+ Am I right on "If want to apply multiple font, use *JTextPane* but not *JTextArea*"?


I haven't realized it yesterday that *getattr* of python is very powerful!!! Until I read the section * **getattr** As a Dispatcher* of *Diving into Python*, really a good book! So, *getattr* perfect my long-ago dream of use a string name to call the function. I'm happy about this.


Some place in python is a little tricky, such as 

	if __name__=="__main__"

or 
	
	bool and a or b

This make python more cordial and kind and lively, not like Java.

Again, a good way to learn, and maybe, the best way.

+ Different between *repr* and *str*

At the end of today, I quick-view the public class of *Stanford programming*.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **66 hours**.
