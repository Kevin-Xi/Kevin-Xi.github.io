I chatted with my teammate and decide to practise the *Django* this week.

Again, I try to built a github page as my blog. This time I have luck to build page correctly, but *Jekyll*(until today did I find this name may come from *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, and I know a python static blog generator named *Hyde*) still mean a kind of magic to me now. I can't modify the index page now!

I made some notes for *The Art of Agile Development*.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **166 hours**.
