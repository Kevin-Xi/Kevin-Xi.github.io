Finally I installed Mint in the VirtualBox on my Windows, for testing my project *RemotePairProgramming*. Some problem solved but other occurs. The BIGGEST problem is still the transmition way. Besides, Mint is beautiful, slow in source.

The two questions I met yesterday, I solve the first one, the reason is stupid: I didn't delete the cookie. So two things I realize: cookies remain more to understand; rest reasonable(yesterday evening I found a classroom to see the movie *Letters of Love* ;))

The question 2, I still have no clue. But I use *HttpResponseRedirect* to solve it, I believe, in the right way than the old one.

I found the syntax of *login.html* is a little odd. Why can't I write the *url 'foo'* things in the way I do in *showpost.html*?

Mark some details:

+ Stop signup and login after signup and login

In the evening I make a big break-through, I finished post module and solve the problem of [Chinese character of mysql][1]. I become familar with this framework.

The basic framework is, somehow, completed:)

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **149 hours**.
