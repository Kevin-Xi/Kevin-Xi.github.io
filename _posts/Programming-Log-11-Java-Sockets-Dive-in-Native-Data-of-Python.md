I came out an idea to transmit a signal during transmiting other data. I open a *socket* for message in/out coming first, while connection established, a new *socket* for data transmiting started. In this way, my data transmiting is functional, but despite using a new thread to listen the message transmiting, the message require is still can't reach. I don't understand.


And I also spend 2 hours on *Internationalization* of the book *introduction to Java Programming*. The example of *Resource Bundles* is so big, so I try to write a toy one, but once I add the *"MyResource_zh.properties"* in the class directory, the program show error encoding, although I type the Chinese word by unicode and save the file also use unicode.


I modified the statistics program afternoon. Something consider to be logic error bugs come out, debugging is really a refinement of though. And I added it an outer program that can generate Hexagram I wrote before by C++. But I think it's too long for python, somewhere should be refined.


It good to be treated like a self-learner by *DIP*.


To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **46 hours**.
