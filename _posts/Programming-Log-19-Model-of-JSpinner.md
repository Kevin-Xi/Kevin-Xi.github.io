Today morning I know what model with JComponent means, and how to do this exactly with JSpinner. 

Our vacation has finished, and courses will resume tomorrow. I'm a little disturb by this, Time to program will drop, and uncertain about the efficiency.

I also somehow, confused by other things, and yesterday I chatted with my friend about those. But I know for sure, an exception need to be thrown, and normal logic will go on. Cheer up!

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **75 hours**.
