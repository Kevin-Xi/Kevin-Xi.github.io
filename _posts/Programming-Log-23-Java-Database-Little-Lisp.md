Today morning and evening I study the chapter of *Java Database Programming*, I have finished it but still blur. I decide to have a try. But when I try to establish a database on *MS SQL Server*, I never know a software can be hard to use like that:( I write some SQL, and the *Management Studio* point out that the name is invalid, but when I execute it, it give me the excepted output. Tomorrow i will find a book of SQL Server:(

This evening I read the *Practical Common Lisp*. In the beginning I decided to read it during vacation, but I study a lot of other things like Java and python. Actually it is not the first time I saw the former chapters of this book, so this time I quickly look through it. Since I know something about python now, so I realize python must influenced by Lisp for many parts. Lisp is intriguing, either *Common Lisp* or *Scheme*.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **88 hours**.
