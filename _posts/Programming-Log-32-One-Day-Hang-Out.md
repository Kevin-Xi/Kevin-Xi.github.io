Today I went to the library of our main campus.

I became to understand some concepts such as "*weak entities set*", "*many to one with mutli-way connections*" by reading the book *Database systems:the complete book*.

And they I read *Foundations of Python network programming*, I learned something about *POST* data to server and framework of server and *CGI* and *mod_python*.

I found nothing about *Django* today. It's so popular.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **110 hours**.
