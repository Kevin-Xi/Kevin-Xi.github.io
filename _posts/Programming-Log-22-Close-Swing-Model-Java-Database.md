Today Afternoon I finished reading all parts of *Swing MVC*, of course, just a quick-view.

In the evening, after the Database class, I started *JDBC*.

The relationship between a language and database vendors. For Java, Database vendors provide APIs, maybe for some small languages, the situation is contrary.

The IT innovation class:

+ O2O
+ RUP

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **84 hours**.
