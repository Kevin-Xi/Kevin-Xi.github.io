I have considered to make a log of my program learning experience. 


I have heared something about 10000 hours theory that hold a point of if you practise one thing over 10000 hours, you will master it. 10000 hours seem to be short, but it actually long, it will take about 10 years if you practise 3 hours a day.


I doubted if I could make it so long. The game bonus theory I have heared may help. Why games cause addiction and attract fully attention? Some believe that it makes people feel achieving, the figure you control get stronger, or the bonus go up day by day... Since the effect of learning is accumulating little by little, it's hard to see achievement in short time, so why don't just make a bonus system to make it easier to figure out? Write down time everyday and see it growing up and reward myself every 100 hours. Just, make a wishful thinking about it;)


I try to including this:

+ Subject
+ Abstraction
+ Questions
+ Time

in the log.
