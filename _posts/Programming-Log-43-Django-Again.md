I ask my teammate to test my site, but he can't, I search the web and found:

	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

could resolve this.

Today morning our team discuss some details of our project. The guy who work backend with me agree to use Django, I feel happy while pressure. And I came up an idea that is *medal system*.

I say "again" in title because the old project has distrubing problem, I can't bear the chaos so I init a new project. Problems remain:

+ Use relative address in template
+ How to get username list?
+ How to pass arguments to *HttpResponseRedirect*?

I hope things go fast tomorrow.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **140 hours**.
