Today morning I read the rest part of *Networkings* of book *introduction to Java Programming*, want to find a way to transmit a signal while the *OutputStream* is taken. I found there are, maybe many ways to do one things, and each way has its own features, but some of them seems to be the same. Is there any "standard" way to do one thing?


I wrote a Java program to post form to a webpage, in order to substitute the not-working python program, I will try it afternoon.


The Java post program also don't work as I respect, I start to suspect if it's not my code is the one goes wrong.


I finished reading *Bytes of Python* this afternoon, a happy journey in brief. Chapter 15 has a brief introduction of some topic, such as *special method*, *single statement blocks*, *list comprehensions*, *receiving tuples and list in function*, *lambda expression*, *exec*, *eval*, *assert*, *repr*. And some helpful guide to a further exploring.
Some questions I have:

+ How to pass dict to function?
+ The usage of *lambda expression*, *exec*, *eval*, *assert*, *repr* as they design.
+ Is there a better choice of GUI developing now?


This evening I start reading *Dive Into Python*, I made 2 chapters. It's quite a book for experienced programmers, with many comparison with other languages, and plenty of diving-in links. The first program is not easy for me, maybe more difficult later. I like this:)


To sum up, I spent **5 hours** on programming today, and totally **42 hours**.
