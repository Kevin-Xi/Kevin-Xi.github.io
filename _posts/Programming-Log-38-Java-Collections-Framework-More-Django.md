I just find a perfect online course *LinuxCast*. It found by Chinese people, contains many few-minutes course, and cover most aspect of Linux.

Afternoon I learned *collections framework* of Java. I wonder why they are so many, I want to understand in what situation they could be used.

By doing the *LinuxCast* course test, I found myself have to lay a solid foundation on Linux.

I know the problem yesterday that about two *views.py*, it because the default project layout recently changed. *The Django Book* followed old version.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **127 hours**.
