I watch all rest of *Stanford programming Methodology* this morning, Something about tokenizers, caesar encryption and memory. There are many bugs in the CaesarCipher program(math stuff, like shifting by use mod and other bad input situation), so I wrote one by myself. I know the mechanism that how computer distributing memorys, which one neither refer by my Java teacher nor O&A teacher,. That's some kind of blind point.


Byebye, Mehran:)


*UserDict* is a funny guy.

Talking about *Garbage Collection*, Mark said: "As a former philosophy major, it disturbs me to think that things disappear when no one is looking at them, but that's exactly what happens in Python."

And the "*reference counting*" really can't sweep the doubly-linked list:) Until 2.0 python fixed it. Mark.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **73 hours**.
