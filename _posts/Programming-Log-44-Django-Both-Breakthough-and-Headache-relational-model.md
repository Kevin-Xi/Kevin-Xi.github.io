Today I will try to get through this things below:

+ Form
+ Signup
+ Login
+ Post

At the end of the day, i only finished the second one, with some understanding of the structure. I think with this, the first and third maybe easy.

But I still feel headache. There are many ways to do one thing, like the urls and signup module. It's hard for a beginner to decide which way to use. And there are still problems:

+ Why pass the *request* to index before doing anything will get a after-login page?
+ Why use *render_to_response* after sign up has no background?

I have a problem on relational model, that is how to describe a many-to-many table?

To sum up, I spent **5 hours** on programming today, and totally **145 hours**.
