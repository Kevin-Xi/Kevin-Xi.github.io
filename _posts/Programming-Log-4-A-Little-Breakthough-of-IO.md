I reviewed the PPT of my Java lessions of school. In the example code, I found how other people use the screwdriver. It indicates that learning by API doc is still difficult for me. I have search the doc, but what I want is a method named *readString()*, *readLine()* or something, I don't think it has a name *readUTF()*. I have noticed that it returns *String*, but since it not my imaginary name, I paid no attention of it. But the listener of *JTextArea* still remain as a problem.


2 chapters *A Byte of Python* today afternoon. Nothing big.


To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **12 hours**.
