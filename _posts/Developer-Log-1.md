The day before yesterday, I try to figure out my status or position in this project. I turn to Chinese traditional *The Book of Change* and divine. A Dui trigram came out.

We have some argument around our two AI model yesterday evening. A wonderful debate occured between C and Sherlock, they moved fast and intense, I was ready to run away when them began to fight each other :D. In short, I cannot catch their thinking. But we really had reach something in common, and we dicided to start.

Before I sleep last night, I recalled their talking in my mind and try to made myself updated. With my poor-function brain, I eventually work something out.

I found, in actually, their models came from one same template. When they instantiated that template, only because they have different goal, C unzip more practical part and Sherlock unzip more research and inquiry part. C stand at a high-level position and Sherlock stand among the individual AI robot.

Because our capability is limited which is a fact, we can only make, say, 1 percent contribution to the all AI Cathedral. What Sherlock's model's work is make a stone pillar for this Cathedral, which take the 1 percent. But what C do, is not only make 10 or 100 stone pillar, but his model has already reach the qualitative change point, he is making the whole Cathedral, and the stuff in this Cathedral like pillars, sculptures and dome only have 1 percent density.

I cannot point out which way is correct or who's goal is more exalted. it's not my job and I believe no one can point this out before real AI come out (people walk in any way now are all explorer, they don't know if his way will lead him to real AI). 

But for me, I perfer to work step-by-step, which means first we make just one pillar, find out if it firm, get a little confidence and then continue to move forward.
