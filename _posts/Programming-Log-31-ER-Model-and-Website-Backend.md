I learned *ER Model* and find it hard to understand when has no well-designed examples.

And then I read *CFan* 2007.9 which gives me some key words about knowledges I should know of website backend:

+ the arguments of *httpd.conf*
+ the arguments of *php.ini*
+ principles of DNS
+ MySQL injection
+ PHP submit filter
+ PHP tutorials
+ A(Address) Record
+ Domain binding

Today we have a discussion on the design of our website, I recommand some features:

+ Unlimited waterfall stream as homepage
+ Binding with SNS account
+ Warning when receive the task
+ Micro-film for propaganda tells a story about a boy who is using our platform with a girl

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **108 hours**.
