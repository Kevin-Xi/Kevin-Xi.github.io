I prepair to take down a long note of questions:

+ Why 

> SGMLParser.**reset(self)** 

+ Why 

> self.pieces.append("`<!%(test)s>`") % **locals()**

+ Why

> SGMLParser.**reset**(self)

+ p105, about new order of namespace

Something touched:

	Using the locals and globals functions, you can get the value of arbitrary variables dynamically, providing the variable name as a string. This mirrors the functionality of the getattr function, which allows you to access arbitrary functions dynamically by providing the function name as a string.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **157 hours**.
