Today Morning, I learned something about *JavaBeans* and *Bean Events* of Java, it's not easy to understand so I decide to learn it when I need it. I also closed some little bug of my program, and the rest part, I decided to fix it when I have configured my VirtualBox.


During yesterday's experience, I have realized the importance of design. I reopen the classical book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*. It's hard to understand for me, so I said "reopen":)


Not so much I have learned today.


To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **54 hours**.
