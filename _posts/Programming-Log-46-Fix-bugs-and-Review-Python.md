Tonight I fix two bugs:

+ the index in url to represent post has limited digit
+ post before authenticate

I still confused by the odd return of  *objects.filters()* method. How, offically, get the value of it? (It's reasonable to design like that way, because *filter* may return multi-result, that should be a list.)

The next step when I get the rational model, I should add "not null" condition to the fields of post.

And I review python code I learned before.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **150 hours**.
