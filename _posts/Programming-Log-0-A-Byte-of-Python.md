Actually I'm not a new comer of python. Last summer vacation I've covered a book *Learning Python the Hard Way*. It's really as it said, a different style programming book. It highly require self-learning ability and a thinking way that study things as you are unfamilar with it (actually, many time "familar" just cover details, it prevent you to think deeply). This style recall me a Hungary physics textbook named *Aliens learn physics* or something, which is totally different with the methodically textbook I've ever seen before. It comes with lots of experiments and force you to think, to make out your own physics laws. It's a good way to learning but make it hard to know a thing entirely or prove my own thought is right. So I decide to practice more with *A Byte of Python*.


I covered the first 4 chapters tonight. Although I have play with python before, I find something intriguing or never come to my mind before. I will make a list about them:

+ I only know the way to execute a python code is 
       python foo.py
   , and I only know the way to execute a perl code is 
        chmod a+x foo.pl
        ./foo.pl

   now I know that the *shebang line* is share between Linux/Unix system.
+ It's amazing that python contains complex number such as 
      (-5+4.1j)
+ Not like perl, the single quotes and the double quotes in string work the same way
+ I don't know what *'r'* in 
      print "%r" %foo
   mean before, now I know it means "raw string", that string before process
+ string will *literal concatenation*, so 
      'hello''world' 
   equals to 
      'helloworld'
   . But 
      print "a","b"
   come out
      a b
   since 
   "a","b" doesn't means add a space between two strings


To sum up, I learned **1 hour** today, and totally **1 hour**.
