Today morning I made a "mindmap-styled" note of *The Art of Agile development*, and our lecturer gave us something about *RUP* and *Agile* this afternoon.

I downloaded the *mod_python-3.3.1* and installed it successfully at last. But why *mod_python-2.7.1* could not work? I think the former should be with python 3 and the later should with python 2. If so, maybe I should find a way to install the later (since I can't code python by python3).

Perhaps because the "maternal effects", this days I found there are many SNS website created by university student. I think a successful product must have a unique concept. Like us, it is "Implicit social".

In the evening I learned database. Some of the practice is interesting.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **103 hours**.
