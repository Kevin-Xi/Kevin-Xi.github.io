Today morning I learned some basic skill of SQL. Understand the principle of *Cartesian product* is important to the efficiency of query.

Digression: Recently I read *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*. It said it's important to keep the rhythm when you do a long time work.

I wonder why django cannot display my image, and then I realized that it needs static file processing. I try to finish signup, login and post module this days.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **133 hours**.
